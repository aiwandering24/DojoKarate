## Summary

This table represents the progression of belt colors in Shotokan Karate and how the complexity of katas increases accordingly. Beginners start at White or White/Yellow belt and learn basic katas such as the Heian series. Progressing belts (Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue) correspond to more advanced Heian and introductory katas like Tekki Shodan. Later belts (Purple, Brown) are associated with challenging katas such as Bassai Dai, Kanku Dai, and the Sentei forms. The highest ranks (Black belts) perform the most complex katas, such as Unsu, Sochin, and Gojushiho. The number of kiai calls and total movements (Count) generally increase with higher belt levels, reflecting the greater difficulty and demands of the advanced katas. Shitei Gata are required katas for grading; Sentei Gata and Jiyu Gata offer additional forms for senior students approaching Black belt.
